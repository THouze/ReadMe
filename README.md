# I hold a doctoral degree in Cell and Molecular Biology and have a background in Patent Law. My interest in bioinformatics and the commercialization of early stage technological innovations led me to pursue a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering. I am a co-founder of several startup companies, including a therapeutic stem cell company. My experience with meta data collection and business intelligence on a biodiesel project sparked my interest in data analytics and big data. I gained formal experience with the Python programming language through immersive data analytics bootcamps and started my own consulting company, working with researchers at the FDA. I am currently pursuing an MBA degree with a concentration in Information Systems and Technology (IN/IT) and working as a Program Officer at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2020. I plan to graduate with my MBA in 2023 and have successfully completed many work-related data science projects while at the NIH. I hope to continue to utilize my data science skills during my career with the federal government.
